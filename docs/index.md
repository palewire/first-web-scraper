# First Web Scraper

A step-by-step guide to writing a web scraper with Python.

## What you will learn

This tutorial will guide you through the process of writing a script that can extract the roster of inmates from [a local government website](https://report.boonecountymo.org/mrcjava/servlet/SH01_MP.I00290s) and prepare it for analysis.

Along the way you'll learn the fundamental of Python, as well as how to use the Requests library to open URLs, how to use Beautiful Soup to parse HTML and how to write data to a CSV file.

## Who can take it

This course is free. The materials assume the reader has little experience with Python and the command line. Newbies should feel welcome. If you have a good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified.

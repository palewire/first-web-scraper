### Contributing to the documentation

After installing the repository, the Sphinx documentation can be edited in the
``docs`` directory and published to ReadTheDocs by pushing changes to the ``master`` branch.

First install the requirements.

```bash
pipenv install
```

Fire up the test server, which will automatically update to show changes made
to the restructured text files in the ``docs`` directory.

```bash
make docs
```

Open ``http://localhost:8000`` in your browser and start making changes.
